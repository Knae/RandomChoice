# RandomChoice
## What It Does
-----
RandomChoice is a Visual Basic program that displays a random text line from a list of lines (referred as a category). It is designed to allow the user to easily add their own list or categories and quickly get a random line from it.Categories can be edited or created through the program itself or by editing the data file directly. It consists of 3 parts:

-Menu: Shows all the currrent categories available. Can open the category editor from here to either add new categories or make new ones. Can also choose a category to open the Main Window with.

-Category Editor: Shows the lines in the new/currrent category. If making a new category, the name of the category can be changed. This name will serve as the data file's name, so it cannot be changed if when editing a category. Lines in the category can be added,edited or removed using buttons on the right side.

-Main Window: Simple core of the system, gets the list of lines and displays a random one each time the "Decide for me" button is pressed.
